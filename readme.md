The Supermarket 

The player must find all the good ingredients to cook his lunch. 
The player will find the right way quickly because there is a chronometer.
If he takes a wrong ingredient, he loses. 

I didn't have time to make several recipes. In the complete game, the computer selects randomly the recipes. The player one plays ans atfer the second player. The game becomes more and more complicated (9 ingredients, after 12 ingredients etc...).
